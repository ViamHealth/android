ViamHealth Android Application CodeBase

The whole codebase is built on gradle build tool. 

Please refer this - http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html.

Personally I(naren) felt Android Studio to be better than Android Eclipse. All that one needs to do is install Android Studio as per the steps in the link above and then say File -> Import Project -> (provide path for the top level build.gradle file).

Please contact narendra.mudigal@viamhealth.com for any further details.
